What I did to build this app:
I used HTML, a little CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js to complete this app.

My task was to apply functionality to the thumbs up and down buttons while also sorting all the comments from most to least upvotes. I successfully do so via the back end and changind some of the CRUD functionality to manipulate those elements present in the project.

## Lessons Learned :
* More familiar with targeting elements in the DOM and using the parentnode and childnode properties
* This was my intro into backend code and proved beneficial in showing me that the backend and front end arent totally different at least not in regard to JS and using Node.
